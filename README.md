# Madd — RedM Systems Developer & Game Programmer

I design **high-performance, immersive systems** for RedM roleplay servers.  
My focus is clean architecture, low CPU usage, and mechanics that feel native to the world.

I also build gameplay systems in **Unreal Engine** and **Unity**, with a strong bias toward scalability and maintainability.
